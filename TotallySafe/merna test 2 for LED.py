#this part is a specially to called the maintwo parameter LED, MODE 
import rpyc # (remote python call) to connect between two process 
import sys  #  provides access to various system-specific parameters and functions that allow interaction with the Python interpreter and the underlying operating system
# by imprting this liberary you gain access to function and object that can use to manipulate command-line arguments, perform operations related to the Python interpreter, and interact with the operating system, such as reading and writing to the standard input/output/error streams, 
# sys.argv is a list containe tyhe command line arguments passed to the python script 
led=sys.argv[1]
mode=sys.argv[2] 
# sys.argv[1] is being assigned to the variable led, and sys.argv[2] is being assigned to the variable mode. This suggests that the script is expecting at least two command line arguments to be passed when it is executed, and the values of these arguments are being stored in the variables led and mode for further processing within the script.
c = rpyc.connect("localhost", #the same in the previous code we need to know the no of port
)
#function is called with the arguments "localhost" and no of port to establish a connection to the bunny-launcher process running on the local machine on port no of port, and the resulting connection object is stored in the variable c.
c.root.blink(led, mode)
#takes led, mode parameter and performs some action accoringly 
#For example, if the command-line arguments passed to the script are "red" for led and "fast" for mode, the line c.root.blink(led, mode) would be interpreted as calling the blink() function on the root object of the c connection with the arguments "red" and "fast", resulting in a request to the bunny-launcher service to blink the LED with a red color and a fast blinking mode. The exact behavior and effect of this request would depend on the implementation of the blink() function in the bunny-launcher service.
